### Website project for SilverNote

## WARNING  :warning:
Please from now on if you are about to add code, it would be best to fork the repo and create a pull request to make sure no code is lost and avoid breaking the website. You can learn more about forking and pull request at the [following link](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) (give it a try, I promise it is simple)
