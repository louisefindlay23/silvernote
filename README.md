### About SilverNote Music

SilverNote Music is a music enterprise hub in Aberdeen that want to promote new music. They take young artists, bands and backstage sound and lighting crew and provide events and compile CDs so they can network within the industry without being locked into a label.

### About the Project

They tasked me and three others to work as a team to create a responsive website that catered to those viewing on computers as well as a younger, mobile audience.

My main responsibilities were communicating with our client and developing the artist page. I pitched the prototype to the wider organisation and gathered feedback from the band members. This feedback informed the music players I created on the artist profiles.

The artist profiles contain music streaming links which popup a small window streaming the artist's songs from Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music using the SilverNote brand colours where possible.
